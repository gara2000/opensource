[TO DO]
- Let the controller be a virtual machine, that can be created with vagrant, this virtual machine will get the requests from the user and crates the docker containers that execute a specific function (e.g run the model)
- This virtual machine will be provisioned using ansible

[PROGRESS]
# - create the controller virtual machine with vagrant
- Created the Architecture: 
  - frontend: angular app 
  - backend: api gateway and multiple microservices 
* Create the frontend UI:
  * first step: user should be able to upload data file and send it to the processing backend service
* Make post requests from the frontend to the backend:
